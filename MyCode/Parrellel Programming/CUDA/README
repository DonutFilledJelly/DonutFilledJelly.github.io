To use PA5, first create an input file containing only numbers.
The first number is the amount of numbers you want to find the average between.
This number is not counted in the mean and variance, and should be an int
Next, provide a list of numbers (floats) seperated with spaces. Make sure you have the same amount
of numbers as your count.
This program does have a limit, and to increase the limit, you will have to change
N - the amount of blocks (Max ~65000)
T - threads per block (Max 1024)
1024 N 1024 T is recommended for anything up to 1 million.
After inputing the count and array into the program, it will return with the average and the variance of the array.
