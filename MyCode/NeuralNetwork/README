To run this program, make sure to use any c++ compiler, and use g++ -o to run it. 

I used "g++ -o lab cs420lab3.cpp" to run this program

Once the executable is runned, it will add to the cvs file test.csv, giving you the data of 50 different patterns consisting of 100 neurons each.
You can use this cvs file to view all the stable and none stable patterns throughout the network.
1 = stable
0 = not stable
You may need to create a csv file named "test.csv" in the same file as the one containing the c++ program
